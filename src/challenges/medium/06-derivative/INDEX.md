# Derivative Of A Function

Create a function that takes numbers `b` and `m` as arguments and returns the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^{b}$ with respect to `x` evaluated at `x = m`, where `b` and `m` are constants.

---

### Examples:

```
derivative(1, 4) ➞ 1
derivative(3, -2) ➞ 12
derivative(4, -3) ➞ -108
```

### Notes:

- `^` in the context of this challenge means `"to the power of"`, also known as the `"exponent"` operator.
